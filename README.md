Hi I'm Aaron,
I am majoring in Computer Engineering and Computer Science at NNU. I'm also the computer engineering lead for NNU's Rocksat-X program that collaborates with NASA, CU and other universities. I did research for NNU's Ag Computer Vision research project. This included researching different machine learning algorithms and techniques to detect and count blossoms in images. I am also the vice chair of NNU's IEEE chapter.

# Current projects:
### Kara
An AI that predicts stock prices using an RNN trained on thousands of bars of stock market data. The AI then uses that prediction to buy stocks with the greatest reward and lowest risk. Currently upgrading the RNN to a reinforcement learning technique using a Deep Q RNN which is capable of buying and selling at the opportune time.

### Dragonfly
DragonFly is a quadcopter capable of shooting targets with foam balls. It is controlled with a Raspberry Pi. Its targeting system uses a CNN to detect targets. It utilizes a PID controller for stability. When complete the DragonFly will be able to autonomously search an area for targets and hit them with the foam balls. A safety system is being developed to ensure misfires do not occur.

### Fruit Count
The Fruit Count program was a part of NNU's Computer Vision Research Project. I researched different techniques to count blossoms in images. Mask-CNN and FCNN algorithms were implemented and researched.
   
### KauIda RockSat-X 2020
NNU's 2020 RockSat-X project's mission is to research radio frequency communication in space, disintegration of 3D printed plastics during re-entry, and virtual reality experiences in space using a 360 degree camera. My task involved designing a system using an Arduino and Raspberry Pi that can communicate via Bluetooth and send signal strength as well as sensor data from the end of a scissor boom. I also designed the master script using python's threading module that will activate and control several devices such as a GoPro, DC motor, Servo motors, 360 degree camera, and the RF experiment when signals are detected from the rocket. I also designed a system to send the signal strength and sensor data back to NASA through the rocket's telemetry lines.

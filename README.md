Hi I'm Aaron,
I am majoring in Computer Engineering and Computer Science at NNU. I'm also the computer engineering lead for NNU's Rocksat-X program that collaborates with NASA, CU and other universities. I did research for NNU's Ag Computer Vision research project. This included researching different machine learning algorithms and techniques to detect and count blossoms in images. I am also the vice chair of NNU's IEEE chapter. 

## Current projects:
- Kara
  - An AI stock trader
- Dragonfly
   - A 3D printed quadcopter with integrated nerf dart shooting ability
   - AI detection and autonomous flight capability
- Fruit Count
   - Computer vision project involving counting blossoms to predict harvest
- Rocksat
   - An experiment testing radio frequency capabilities in space
